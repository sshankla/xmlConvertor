# Developer notes.

1. Created a mapping.conf file
2. This file would have mapping of Columns to Values
3. A new function initialize has been put in.
4. This function will dynamically create the number of keys that need to be inserted in list_of_dictionary based on mappings.conf
5. For example if mappings.conf has 3 values, then only 3 <K,V> pair would be created. If it has 9 values then 9 <K,V> pair would be created
6. Each <K,V> pair is actually a mapping of Value to Column in CSV file.
7. Value has to be inserted be end user in sample xml
8. createlistofdict function is hard wired to have only 7 columns and follow a pattern based on column and csv file
9. For example: the line temp_dict['fromIP']=tokens[0] has two drawbacks: a) CSV has to ensure that first column is IP address and b) this only works for geo_info.xml and not for generic xmls.
Next Step:
1. create a new function n_createlistofdict that will create list_of_dictionary based on dictionary sample returned by initialize function.
